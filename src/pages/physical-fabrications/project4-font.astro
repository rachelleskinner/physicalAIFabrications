                </div>

                <h2 class="pText"><b style="color: #597487;">AI & Physical Comparison Statement</b></h2>
                <p class="pText" style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    <b>This AI output is probably the worst out of the three physical fabrication AI outputs as it completely missed the accordion book format despite modifying this part of the prompt multiple times. </b>
                    However, DALL-E 3 was able to capture English letters including the newspaper background for the most part. 
                    The font itself does present the wavy, flowness in a different way than the physical fabrication as it looks very clean and perfect, going against the authenticity and possibly counterculture keywords. 
                    It attempted to convey the music keyword through random music symbols such as the treble clef in the bottom left image, a complete opposite of how I evoked this key term in the physical fabrication. 
                    This specific output also is my most liked, if I had to choose. 
                    It somewhat captured the newspaper, wavy, flow, and colorfulness of the prompt with a take on the music keyword. 
                    <b>Although the AI font looks interesting in its own way, like the intricate waves inside the characters, it completely misses the message I was going for and possibly all my keywords, depending on the specific output image.</b>
                </p>
                <p class="pText" style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    My first impressions of creating a font and the typography subject were, “Oh, this is easy, it's just letters,” but I was completely wrong. 
                    <b>A lot goes into creating a font when looking at it from a technical typography perspective like the anatomy of a typeface, precision, consistency, and readability among all the letters, numbers, and possibly symbols. </b>
                    While also keeping in mind the infinite combinations the characters could form. 
                    My keywords and who I am somewhat saved me from the technicality aspect as I like to go against the norm. 
                    <b>However, type designers should be praised for following these technicalities as it is difficult to consider all the aspects that go into a font that I haven't already listed like accented letters, italics, underlining, bolded styles, the list goes on. </b>
                    The AI output did not and cannot consider these aspects other than the English alphabet as limitedly prompted. 
                    However, it did keep up with the consistent styling of each letter.
                </p>
                <p class="pText" style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    Lastly, it is also important to note the excessive amount of time iterating and changing prompts, including the use of other generative AI image platforms like Adobe’s AI Font Generator. 
                    This platform actually does a worse job of capturing the physical fabrication as it was limited to just font’s bare letter structure, not the metadata like the presentation format and font name. 
                    <b>I was surprised that I liked DALL-E 3’s generations than Adobe’s as its sole purpose is generating fonts. 
                    DALL-E 3’s AI generative prompts ignored the presentation format and some of the keywords but was still able to capture a general idea of my physical fabrication font. </b>

                <!-- Single column for text -->
                <h2 class="subTitle my-5">Intentionality & Design Statement </h2>
                <p class="pText" style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    My consistent keywords are connection, music, counterculture, and authenticity. 
                    <b>I decided the overall layout of SWLABR Typeface to be a spin on the cut-out magazine letters. </b>
                    This format evokes counterculture and authenticity with the ripped newsletter background including how it also could be a symbol of connection as it was once an entire sheet. 
                    The font follows a nontraditional typography approach with each letter following different flows, colors, and sizes while also taking a 60s-70s style approach, continuing the counterculture theme. 
                    The metadata plays an important part with the accordion format embodying connection and the title, SWLABR Typeface, representing music. 
                    <b>It is the title of a 1967 track by Cream and an acronym, She Was Like a Bearded Rainbow, including its album similarly featuring vivid colors like this font. </b>
                    The style and lyrics of the track and band feature Dadaism, an art movement that focuses on absurdly expressing art and rejecting reasoning.  
                    <b>As well as lyrical details of Marcel Duchamp’s Readymades, an artist's style of modifying an image or object in some way, overlapping with my other keywords of counterculture and authenticity. </b>
                </p>
                <p class="pText" style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    <b>I feel that my font primarily evokes these key terms with styles of whimsical absurdness, weird, and resourceful embodiment which I personally enjoy. </b>
                    The idea of sustainability through being resourceful with my materials also generates an overall positive for both myself, reducing waste and spending no money, and the audience, receiving the message of being inventive with random materials. 
                    With the playful absurdity communicating the message of doing things outside of the normal, circling back to my keywords. 
                    These responses are important to me because it is who I am and what I am about. 
                    My project construction process was pretty straightforward. However, I encountered problems with presenting the letters, evoking music, and connecting with time and ability constraints too. 
                    Dr. Anna Mukamal gave me the idea of the accordion book presentation symbolizing connection. 
                    This layout restricted me to not go too overboard as the final draft details no lowercase and included additional numbers and symbols instead, helping with time. 
                    <b>I took the metadata approach with the music keyword as I wanted to keep my keywords consistent throughout all my projects but did not want to convey this term too literally. </b>
                    Lastly, the time I anticipated to complete this project was as expected, multiple working days due to the multiple characters and the construction of the accordion format. 
                    <b>However, the drawing and sizing of each character were a little more difficult to capture perfectly since it was by hand, but the process was fun and felt less like work. </b>
                    Although my digitizations are pictures currently, I do plan to create this into a digital display font for this project’s mini-portfolio using the Fontself extension with Adobe Photoshop.
